# GeoSpatial Imagery Pipeline and NDVI Analysis Tool

Hi. This project was initially a final project for a course, but I intend to continue working on it for further research. If you are a grader or just simply like to see the identical notebook from my presentation on YouTube, please check my past commits. 

Whenever there is a package (from req.txt) related issue, update it via pip.
